                      <p>
                        Campos Chapel St blend will delight you with a fusion of vibrant flavours, just like the iconic Melbourne precinct it was named after.

                        Notes of citrus fruits, jasmine honeysuckle and red apple are just some of the flavours which shine through in this delicious blend. These fruity and floral flavour characteristics are synonymous with some of the most premium coffee varieties in the world.

                        We've favoured a slightly lighter roast degree to highlight the flavour notes and produce an exceptional cup of specialty coffee. Perfect as a longer shot.
