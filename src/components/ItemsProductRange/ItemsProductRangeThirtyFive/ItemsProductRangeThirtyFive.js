                      <p>
                        Who said decaf coffee can't taste good? We take this coffee very seriously because we love delivering a delicious decaf for everyone to enjoy.

                        Our decaffeinated specialty coffee blend is marked by notes of cocoa, malt and wild berries. This is an elegant espresso with the unmistakable prominence of real coffee flavours.
